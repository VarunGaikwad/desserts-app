## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them.
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart.
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order".
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order".
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:

- Implementing local storage to save the cart state between sessions.
- Adding unit tests for the key components.
- Exploring further responsive design techniques.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This was helpful in understanding the utility-first approach.
- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - A great resource for understanding React fundamentals.
